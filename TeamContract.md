## Team Norms and Expectations

*Team member will respond to messages within 10 hours on weekdays.

* Teammates should notify for any tutorials (where marked activities are), any marked assignments, or any projects that they are missing. 

* Team memmbers should be completing work on time, collaboratively if needed, with code that meets or exceeds the standards. If members aren't able to complete their work/tasks, need help or require rubber-ducking they must notify at least 36 hours in advance. For all decisions, every team member should be consulted, and all ideas should be noted (even if they are not used).

### [Other Categories of norms and expectations go here]

- Direct commits to the `main` branch are strictly prohibited. Regularly synchronize your branch with `main` to maintain currency.
- All deliverables must be completed on schedule, fully tested, and compliant with the agreed quality standards.  
- Every Pull Request requires review and approval from at least two team members.  
- Resolve merge conflicts only after consulting the original author of the conflicting code.  
- Announce any new feature before implementation by documenting it in the project README.
- All code must include comments (at minimum, brief explanations) to aid comprehension.  
- Do not commit environment or build-related files (e.g., `.idea`, `target/`). Such files must remain excluded via `.gitignore`.
- Maintain a level of clean and quality code.
- **If you use AI** leave a comment mentioning that AI was used.

---

## Decision Making

- Decisions are made by consensus, or majority (by vote).

---
## Conflict resolution

- Conflict will be resolved through private discussion between the conflicting members, then adding someone else on the team, and finally, if required, requesting a TA to intervene.

---

## Accountability

- All members agree to be honest about their work, and to provide honest, fair peer evaluations
- Lack of participations or inability to meet expecations will results in lower peer evaluation scores.
- Work must be done at least 6 hours before the deadline (unless approved by other members).
